# NextStep Website

This repository contains the source code for a simple, responsive website for the NextÂ Step project. It uses plain HTML, CSS and JavaScript and is hosted via GitHub Pages.

## Getting started

Open `index.html` in your browser to view the site locally. The layout includes a navigation bar, a hero section, an About section and a Contact section. You can modify the text in these sections directly in `index.html` to reflect your own content.

## Customisation

- **Styling**: All colours, fonts and layout rules are defined in `style.css`. Update the CSS variables at the top of the file to change the colour palette, or adjust other rules to tweak spacing and typography.
- **Scripts**: Interactive behaviour such as the mobile navigation menu and call-to-action message lives in `js/main.js`. If you add new interactive elements, put their scripts here.

## Deployment

This site is configured to be served using GitHub Pages. Commit your changes to the `main` branch and GitHub will automatically build and deploy the updated site. To run the site locally without a server, open `index.html` in your browser, or use a local HTTP server for a closer simulation.
